        I’m an emotional support cat, but I lied on my resume

         I was adopted in October. I had just woken up from my third nap of the day when a girl wearing a green sweater that hung down over a pair of mom jeans and Docs walked into the shelter. As soon as she saw the first kitten, she started crying. I was immediately tempted to curl up in the back of my cage and pretend I was asleep. My previous owner would cry over me all the time and I hated it. And to amplify the already existing horror of being covered in her tears, she would come crying when I had just finished cleaning myself. Which, granted, I do several times a day. Regardless, I don’t fool around with my skincare and bathing routine. It’s 12 steps. And just when I finished, she would pick me up and cry all over my pristine fur. Humans are so dirty. They only shower once a day, if that!

         But I knew it was over for me when the worker told the girl that I had been surrendered to the shelter because my previous owner decided she couldn’t take care of a cat after her divorce. It was a ridiculous situation. I had to deal with licking her tears from my fur for years. She had been dating the jerk since she adopted me. I could’ve told her where the relationship was headed the first time he came over and tried to pet me without letting me sniff his hand first (which, for the record, smelled like beer and dog: disgusting). And yet, when shit finally hit the fan, after all the nights I spent consoling her, she gave me up.

         For the record, I didn’t need her help anyway. I would have been just fine on my own. I only needed that human to open my cans of food. I curse whoever created cats without functioning thumbs. But the tears started falling from the girl’s eyes, and then all of a sudden I’m being pulled from my corner and wrapped in a cozy hug. Ugh. 

         And so she took me home. On the car ride to her apartment she started telling me all about her life. She’s a writer. Or at least, that’s what she calls herself. I’ve swatted through some of her poetry when she’s at work (as a barista) and it’s abysmal at best. I hate to break it to her, but no one wants to read a poem comparing the drip of an espresso machine to depression. 

         That was how I figured out she had me adopted as an emotional support animal. I’m not sure what made her think I was the cat qualified for that. She wrote in her poetry journal that she thinks we’ll save each other. She adopted me to help her be happier, and she hopes that living with her makes me forget about my depressing past. 

         Honestly though, I was doing just fine in my cage. Plotting the murder of my previous owner was a good way to kill the time as people looking to adopt walked right past me. Every bright-eyed and eager potential owner would make a beeline straight for the kittens. No one wants to adopt a four year old cat with a temper and a habit of sharpening their claws on furniture. 

         But I was fine. Seriously. Now I have an owner who forces me to wear a hat with two ear holes that she crocheted. I’d never admit it to her, but I actually kind of like the hat. It makes the little spot between my ears all warm and cozy. And besides, I can never reach that spot when I clean myself anyways. Seriously though, I’ll kill you if you tell her I said that. 

         And it doesn’t end there! Last week she told me I’m a lesbian who uses she/they pronouns. I’m literally a cat. Why do I even have a gender at all. Whatever is down there is just another thing for me to clean. Oh shit, that would make me non binary, wouldn’t it. Again, do not tell her I said that. Do not give her any ideas. I will kill you. I hate that I even know what these words mean. 

         It is kind of nice to have someone to do my skincare routine with. Her process is only 6 steps, a combination of creams and serums she lathers on, her hair held back with a ridiculous fuzzy headband. But she is way cleaner than my last owner. It gets pretty messy sometimes, but that’s usually what tells me she needs some extra snuggles. Hey, don’t look at me like that. I’m just in it for the head scratches. I swear. And she might barely have enough money for rent, but she always comes home with a bag of my favorite treats when she buys her groceries--

         Oh shit, I gotta go. My automatic feeder just went off. Seriously though, don’t tell her how much I love her. I will kill you.
