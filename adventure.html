       Notes from a field in Connecticut 
    </title>
        
<p class="indent"> 
I embarked upon a great adventure this past week. I found myself in a cottage in Connecticut. It was a town that is not quite distinctive from any other town, the sort of place you drive through, unless you are looking to live on unproductive farmland. Connecticut itself has never existed as anything more than a place I have driven through, the dreadfully thick state that seems never ending as many road trips have dragged me along its roads. 
    </p>
    <p class="indent">
    
Yet, I have made myself a friend who calls this at-first-glance boring and drab state home, and thus I set out to discover the possibilities between and among the farmhouses and fields. 
        
        </p>
    <p class="indent">
        
When I made a left from the ivy-covered gate outside of the house, I found myself walking up a road, past a dingy lake beach, and up to a hiking path. It was a beautiful path up a mountain that led me to a viewpoint of a vast stretch of Connecticut. There is a lot I could say about the journey up the snowy path, my relief and awe upon reaching the summit, or the tribulations of the hike down, which ended up being more of a slip down the mountain. Whenever I stand within an awe-inspiring place of nature, I cannot help but feel the call of what has inspired so many writers before me. The words seem to write themselves as I stand before the beautiful and wild. It is no wonder why so many of the greats have chosen seclusion in nature to ponder the meaning of life and spend their days writing. However, this hike is not the adventure of which I am writing. 
        
        </p>
    <p class="indent">
        
Instead I am writing of the journey I found myself on when I turned right out of the gate outside of the house. The road upon which I set my feet spanned for miles, many more than I myself was able to traverse before a beastly creature inside of me began groaning for lunch.
        
        </p>
    <p class="indent">
        
I started up the hilly road and found myself walking past several houses and barns. Each house was unique in its architecture, yet the feeling they inspired in me was quite the same. One simple house after the next, set upon a vast stretch of hilly land, inside which I could imagine equally simple people with equally simple lives. There was not much to feed my imagination, and so I turned to quiet introspection as I walked.
I continued on this way, regarding each simple house with an equally simple recognition, until my feet paused beside a field. What follows is the true account of my adventure. Whether I am the hero or the villain of my story, the brave warrior or the coward, is for you to decide.

        </p>
    <p class="indent">
        
Something told my sneakers to slow to a stop before I became conscious of my it myself. And then, I felt the field calling to me. It was quiet at first, beckoning me to run through its expanse. I could feel its ache to be touched now that the blanket of snow had melted away. Its only comfort is the late winter sun, its warmth not quite strong enough to thaw the hard ground. It called me to bring my feet upon it; I could hear the urgency in its voice. There was a break in the short stone wall that surrounded the field, and it beseeched me to cross its threshold, to acquaint myself with the tired grass, to be its company as we wait for the distant sun. The landscape reached its outstretched arms to me, a promise of something intangible to fill my writhing mind. I was overwhelmed suddenly with the beckoning silence. Why me? I cried out to the field. 
        
        </p>
    <p class="indent">
        
The silence was roaring in my ears now, and it filled me as I turned and ran from it. I did not stop running until I reached the church atop Gun Hill road, until the only sound in my ears was my ragged breath. I stood there panting for a moment, to catch my breath. 
        
        </p>
    <p class="indent">
        
I took the long way back to my friendâ€™s house, avoiding the field entirely. I can still hear its whispers now as I write this, tucked safely on the couch that sits by the window with a view of a waterfall. 
        
        </p>
    <p class="indent">
        
I do not know what the field wanted from me, and why it chose me to call. I do not know whether I failed to respond to its calls, or perhaps my writing of this story is precisely what it wanted. I do not have a message to leave you with, only my recounting of this story. Perhaps you will now set out into the mundane, and find yourself on an adventure you never expected. Or perhaps you will shut off your screen, and forget about my story, and the field, as so many have forgotten it before.
